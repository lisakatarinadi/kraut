## roles

### Scrum Master: Mark
- Clearing obstacles: The first obstacle we had, was that we all needed to understand databases first to a sufficient degree and that Mark, who is our scrum master was sick for 3 days so we had to catch up and sync with each other which put us behind schedule. We had to delay some things because of that but those were mostly cleared up by combined effort.
- Establishing an environment where the team can be effective: We decided on GitHub for that. Not only for uploading the SQL files but for organizing the whole project. It has worked amazingly well so far. 
- Addressing team dynamics: Since we all work together already, this was an non issue to figure out.
- Ensuring a good relationship between the team and product owner as well as others outside the team: Same as the previous point, we were never struggling with that point since our roles were clearly defined and we had previous experiences of working together and helping each other out.
- Protecting the team from outside interruptions and distractions: Mark, our Scrum master, is making sure that we are following the Scrum guidelines and using Trello. After we have all caught up with each other it has been going well. One issue is that one us works from home and the other two work from school. This leads to some issues with coordinating breaks and really getting focused work in, so we have to do a lot of assigning work instead.

### Product Owner: Lisa
- Clearly identify and describe product backlog items in order to build a shared understanding of the problem and solution with the product development team: 
This was done through GitHub, which we used extensively to communicate and understand backlogs and individual tasks.
- Make decisions regarding the priority of product backlog items in order to deliver maximum outcome with minimum output: This was a bit more difficult to organize in hindsight, we mostly did priority through Trello board as well as using the Webex chat. As said previously, Mark missing out put a bit of a stop into our moment so we had to do more communication over text than we would have liked. In the end this was not a big issue however.
- Determine whether a product backlog item was satisfactorily delivered: Most of our backlogs were worked on with no big issues once we were all on the same page.
- Ensure transparency into the upcoming work of the product development team: This is something we are working hard on to figure out and set up! We were even thinking about using paid online options for having a collaborative database for us to work on. 

### Tech-Lead: Fynn
- A tech leader (technical leader) as name suggests is a person responsible for tech leaderleading a development group. Tech lead guides the technical decision within a team. Using leadership skills, the responsibility of a tech lead is to drive, lead, motivate the team and its members:
Fynn has been working hard to understand the more difficult technological aspects and to get us up to date. We have a working Database but still need to figure out some of the query tasks. As soon as the rest of the tasks are finished Lisa and Mark will focus their efforts on the technological aspect as well.

- Sharing resources
- Fluent and effortless communication channels.

## Clarity

> Points to consider

- We do not all have the same level of expertise. 
- We do not have the same systems running so there might be technological differences.
- We will have to do a lot of self study. The relevant sources used will be added to github. 
- We will use GitHub as our main presentation platform. This means it needs to be visually pleasing and easy to understand.
- We need to clarify with the teacher if presenting the finished databse is enough or if query by query is demanded.

## Preparation

> Before we start....

- We use MeisterTask https://www.meistertask.com/app/project/n49KDnnO
- We will use a more text based approach primarily on github rather than the visual approach of MeisterTask unless it is about sub tasks.
- We have prepared our GitHub README and set up our SCRUM page. 
- We will have to make a category on GitHub where we can commit .SQL files and create an additional README/QUERY.md file.
- We will have to consider setting up an online SQL server where we can run queries against.
